# 🚀 React + Vite Project

This project is developed using **React** with **Vite** as the build tool.
Vite offers a **lightning-fast development experience** with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and produces a **highly optimized production build**.

The project follows **modern frontend development practices** while maintaining a **simple, beginner-friendly structure**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

*  **Fast Development** using Vite
*  **Component-Based Architecture** with React
*  **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** for instant updates
*  **Optimized Production Build**
*  **Deployment-Ready** for platforms like Netlify

---

##  Learning Outcomes

After completing this experiment, the learner will be able to:

* Understand the **folder structure** of a React project created with Vite
* Build and run a React application using **modern build tools**
* Clearly distinguish between **development mode** and **production build**
* Deploy a React application on **Netlify** using the `dist` folder
* Understand the core concept of **Single Page Applications (SPA)**

## 🧠 Single Page Application (SPA) vs Multi Page Application (MPA)

| Feature             | SPA (Single Page Application) | MPA (Multi Page Application)           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Page Load**       | Loads one HTML file initially | Loads a new HTML page for each request |
| **Performance**     | Faster after first load       | Slower due to repeated reloads         |
| **Navigation**      | No page refresh               | Page refresh on navigation             |
| **User Experience** | Smooth, app-like              | Traditional website feel               |
| **Examples**        | React, Angular, Vue           | Classic HTML, PHP sites                |

## 🛠️ Build & Deployment

To generate a **production-ready build**, the following command is used:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a **`dist` folder**, which can be directly deployed on **Netlify** or any static hosting platform.
